Unveiling the hidden insights behind opinions.

## Inspiration
The ever-growing volume of online hotel reviews presents a treasure trove of valuable insights into traveler experiences. While star ratings provide a general overview, they often lack the nuance and detail to fully understand the factors that influence a guest's satisfaction. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) addresses this gap by identifying and analyzing sentiments expressed towards specific aspects of a hotel, such as cleanliness, service, location, and value.

## What it does
Our ABSA project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to extract and analyze sentiment from hotel reviews, providing a comprehensive understanding of guest opinions on various aspects of the hotel experience. By breaking down overall reviews into individual aspects, the project uncovers hidden patterns and trends that can inform decision-making and improve customer satisfaction.

## How we built it
The ABSA project leverages a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to extract and analyze sentiment from hotel reviews. The process involves:
Data Collection: Gathering a large corpus of hotel reviews from various sources, ensuring data diversity and quality.
Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data by removing noise, handling misspellings, and tokenizing sentences into individual words.
Aspects Extraction & Sentiment Analysis: Applying LLM, to extract aspects and classify sentiment towards specific aspects.

## Challenges we ran into
Data Ambiguity: Dealing with the inherent ambiguity of natural language, where words can have multiple meanings or express varying degrees of sentiment.
Aspect Identification: Accurately identifying the specific aspects mentioned in reviews, which can be complex and context-dependent.
Sarcasm and Irony: Handling sarcasm and irony, which can be challenging to detect due to their subtle linguistic cues.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
High Sentiment Classification Accuracy: Achieving high accuracy in classifying sentiment towards various aspects of hotel reviews.
Insightful Aspect Analysis: Uncovering hidden patterns and trends in customer sentiment, providing valuable insights for hotel management.

## What we learned
The Power of LLM: LLM can effectively handle large amounts of data and provide valuable insights.

## What's next for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
Exploring Multilingual Sentiment Analysis: Expanding the project to handle multilingual reviews, enabling broader cross-cultural insights.
Integrating with Recommendation Systems: Incorporating ABSA findings into recommendation systems to provide personalized hotel suggestions based on user preferences.
Real-Time Sentiment Monitoring: Developing real-time sentiment monitoring tools to track customer feedback and identify potential issues promptly.
